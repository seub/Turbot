TODO

General C++ question: is it ok to have uninitialized constructors (e.g. PositionZ), even though I would never want such objects to be used, so that I can apply methods
like bool applyMove(Position &res)?

Test number of collisions



BUGS
BasicMovePickerZ does not play the same moves as BasicMovePickerHashZ ?? Test depth 4, play against itself.
Oh no that's normal! It's because it->second).depth >= depth is not ==
